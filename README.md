# CalculationOfBMIIndex
If-Else-If Ladder
Please create a program that will calculate the BMI (I encourage you to use the Math.pow () method) afteruser enters his height and weight (example variable names: heightBielecki, weightBielecki) - the variables passed by the user are assigned to the float type. 
After calculating the BMI value, thanks to the if-else-if ladder statement, the value will be assigned to the appropriate range and the correct message will appear on the console. Intervalsof BMI index:
- 16.00 – starvation
- 16.00 - 16.99 – emaciation
- 17.00 - 18.49 – underweight
- 18.50 - 22.99 – normal, low range
- 23.00 - 24.99 – normal, high range
- 25.00 - 27.49 – overweight, low range
- 27.50 - 29.99 – overweight, high range
- 30 - 34.9 – 1st degree obesity
- 35 - 39.9 – 2nd degree obesity
- 40 – 3rd degree obesity
